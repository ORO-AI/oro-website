# ORO Website

Landing page for ORO, a personal stylist powered by AI.

## Overview

A scroll-journey landing page designed for brand awareness. The site unfolds a narrative as users scroll, moving from the problem (fragmented shopping research) to the solution (ORO as your personal stylist).

## Design Principles

- **Calm under complexity** - Minimal, restrained design that signals confidence
- **Warm and approachable** - Light backgrounds, elegant typography, no aggressive CTAs
- **Signal over stimulation** - Each section makes one clear point
- **Privacy-first messaging** - Emphasizes user alignment, not surveillance

## Structure

1. **Hero** - ORO wordmark with "Your personal stylist. Coming soon."
2. **Problem** - Names the tension of endless research with no purchase
3. **The Turn** - Introduces ORO as the solution
4. **Philosophy** - Two promises: comprehensive search + privacy
5. **Close** - "Coming soon" with contact info
